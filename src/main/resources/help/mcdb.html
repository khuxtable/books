	<h1>Media Collection Database</h1>

	<p>
		The Media Collection Database is a simple application that maintains a
		linked set of <a href="#authors">authors</a>, <a href="#titles">titles</a>,
		<a href="#volumes">volumes</a>, and <a href="#borrowers">borrowers</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="basicConcepts">Basic Concepts</h2>

	<p>
		There are four types of elements within the Media Collection Database:
		<a href="#authors">authors</a>, <a href="#titles">titles</a>, <a
			href="#volumes">volumes</a>, and <a href="#borrowers">borrowers</a>.
	</p>

	<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>

	<p>An author is a creator of a title. A title can have more than
		one author. A title can have no authors, but that is usually only the
		case when you are first entering the title information.</p>

	<p>When entering a new work by a new author, enter and save the
		author's information first. Then enter the title and add the author to
		it.</p>

	<h3 id="titles">Titles</h3>

	<p>Titles are the core elements of the Media Collection Database. A
		title is any element you wish to store, e.g. a story, a poem, a song,
		or a collection of elements, e.g. a poetry collection, a fiction
		anthology, a CD, etc.</p>

	<p>When entering a collection, such as a poetry collection, a short
		story collection, or a CD or album, enter the collection first, then
		enter the poem, story, or song and add it to the collection.</p>


	<h3 id="volumes">Volumes</h3>

	<p>Volumes are physical entities. (For the purposes of the
		application, a Kindle book or an mp3 file is a physical entity.) A
		volume is something you can purchase, loan to someone, and/or hold in
		your hand.</p>

	<p>Volumes are a somewhat confusing concept, but essentially, a
		volume only exists as a concept to contain a title that can be
		purchased, loaned, etc. You generally cannot loan one poem in a
		collection to someone else. A volume is created to track the physical
		characteristics of a book, say, such as its binding type (paper,
		hardcover), its ISBN, its publication date, etc.</p>

	<p>When entering a new book or CD, create the title first, then add
		the volume.</p>


	<h3 id="borrowers">Borrowers</h3>

	<p>A borrower is someone who has at some point borrowed a volume in
		the collection.</p>

	<p>When someone borrows a volume for the first time, enter the
		borrower, then check out the book to them. When they return the volume
		there is no need to delete the borrower. Just check the volume back
		in. The borrower may borrow another volume in the future.</p>

	<h2 id="initialSetup">Initial Setup</h2>

	<p>Copy the application to your application folder.</p>

		<code>C:\Users\username</code>
		<br /> Mac or Linux:
		<code>/Users/username</code>
		<br /> create a folder called
		<code>.mediacollectiondatabase</code>
		and unzip the base database (
		<code>db.zip</code>
		) into it.
